### Lecture 1: Introduction to Operating Systems

---

#### **1. What is an Operating System?**
An **Operating System (OS)** is a program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. Its primary goals are:
1. To execute user programs and make problem-solving easier.
2. To make the system convenient for users.
3. To utilize computer hardware efficiently.

**Example:** When you use a smartphone, the OS ensures your applications (like WhatsApp or Gmail) run smoothly and interact with the hardware (like the CPU or camera).

#### **2. Computer System Structure**
A computer system consists of four main components:
1. **Hardware:** Provides basic computing resources such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
2. **Operating System:** Coordinates the use of hardware among applications and users.
3. **Application Programs:** Define how system resources are used to solve user problems (e.g., web browsers, games).
4. **Users:** People, machines, or other computers.

#### **3. What Operating Systems Do**
The role of an OS can be viewed differently:
- **From the User's Perspective:** 
  - Users seek convenience and usability (e.g., intuitive interfaces).
  - Handheld devices optimize for usability and battery life.
- **From the System's Perspective:** 
  - The OS is a **resource allocator** (e.g., CPU time, memory).
  - The OS is a **control program** ensuring proper and efficient resource usage.

#### **4. Computer Startup**
At startup:
- A **bootstrap program** initializes the system, stored in **ROM/EPROM** (firmware).
- This program sets up the CPU, device controllers, memory, and loads the OS kernel.

---

#### **5. Operating System as a Resource Manager**
The OS manages:
- **Processes:** Executes programs in a controlled manner.
- **Memory:** Allocates memory to processes and manages swapping.
- **Storage:** Organizes files and directories and ensures data persistence.
- **I/O Devices:** Interfaces between devices and the system using drivers.

#### **Interactive Questions**
1. **Why is the Operating System important in a computer system?**

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   The OS acts as an intermediary between hardware and users, efficiently managing resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
   </details>

2. **What happens during the computer's boot process?**

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   The bootstrap program initializes the system, sets up hardware components, and loads the OS kernel into memory.
   </details>

3. **Can you give an example of how an OS optimizes hardware usage?**

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   The OS schedules processes so that the CPU and I/O devices are never idle, thereby optimizing hardware efficiency.
